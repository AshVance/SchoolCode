Notes:

Data that describes an object are called attributes
	Attributes are kept separate from other parts of the program
	Attributes can only be accessed via functions called methods

Example of a class:
Class - Person
	Objects - John, Alison, Simon (objects are an instance of a class)
		Each of these objects contain their own attributes (they could be hair, eye colour, etc)

Creating an object is called instantiation

Another example:
Class - Ball
	Object - Football
	Attributes:
		Volume (integer)
		Weight (integer)
		Diameter (integer)
	Actions:
		KickBall()
			- Could return speed/angle of kick
		CatchBall()
			- Decides whether the keeper catches the ball or not
		ThrowBall()
			- The keeper throws the ball after catching it
	Object - Tennis Ball
	Attributes:
		Volume (integer)
		Weight (integer)
		Diameter (integer)
	Actions:
		HitBall()
		ServeBall()
