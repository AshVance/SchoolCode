# SchoolCode
C# programs I've made at school, usually fun little programs. This will usually include the .cs source code files only; open a new project in Visual Studio or another such IDE in order to run.

These are not part of a greater project, this is simply a repo to collect all my code together in one place. Therefore, many programs will be incomplete and/or uncommented. Smaller projects are organised into the months in which they were created, larger projects including multiple files shall be organised into specific folders paired with a README file.
